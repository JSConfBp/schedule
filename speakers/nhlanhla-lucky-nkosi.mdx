  The web is fast becoming the main means through which people interact with all sorts of technologies. With every new invention, users ask "but can it work with a browser?"  With modern Web APIs, the answer is almost always yes; even to the question "can you fly a drone with a banana?"
</p>
<p>
  In this talk, I show the audience the power of said APIs and discuss a few cool experimental APIs. I do this by taking them on a journey through my experience of trying to hack a drone and fly it with a banana and close it off by letting the entire crowd fly the drone through Twitter in real-time.

  If you're interested in all things web, custom controllers, Bluetooth technology, and accelerometer-based controls, or if you just like fruit and seeing silly applications of web technology, this talk is for you.

  I work as a Software Engineer in the R&D team of a company called BBD in Johannesburg, South Africa. I have experience in building and maintaining enterprise banking software with varying tech-stacks; all the way from VB6 and .Net to web and cloud technologies.

  Some of my biggest interests are education and activism. To feed these passions, I am currently also a lecturer at Wits University's Digital Arts department, a Board member of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation, and a national coordinator for the DSAC Social Cohesion Advocates board.
