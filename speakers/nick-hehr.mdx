  It is becoming easier and more approachable to connect our homes and appliances to the Internet without regards
  to what happens when that Internet becomes unavailable or unreliable. Using existing standards and networking
  technologies, we can build more secure and resilient “smart spaces” without the Internet, as well as make
  custom solutions on low-powered devices using JavaScript!

  Nick is an empathetic community member, full-stack developer, and avid Disney parks & animation fan.
  When he’s not speaking at local meetups or contributing to the Tessel and Johnny-Five projects,
  you can probably find him at the nearest climbing gym. His mustache is a figment of your imagination.
