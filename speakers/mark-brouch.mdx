  In this presentation, I will tell the story of how we built a telehealth app in the browser for doctors to see patients virtually during the pandemic, and how we implemented a virtual backgrounds feature so that doctors can always have a professional-looking video background, even when seeing patients from home.
I will explain how machine learning in the browser works with TensorFlow.js, and how to use segmentation models to identify a person in an image with BodyPix. I will also cover how to take ML segmentation data and use it to paint a virtual background behind a person on a video call using HTML Canvas compositing techniques - all in JavaScript. Finally, I will demo this feature with a sample video chat web application running on Twilio.
