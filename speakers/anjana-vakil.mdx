Generators have been around in JavaScript since ES2015, yet remain largely ignored by many JS devs, who don't see why or 
how they'd use them in their day-to-day work. But generators - which we can think of as special functions whose execution 
can be "paused" and resumed later on - are actually extremely powerful tools for producing and consuming series of data. 
That makes them perfect for implementing lazy sequences, custom iterables, animation, even the convenient asynchronous 
programming we now enjoy with "await"! In this talk we'll dive into how JS generators work, what makes them so powerful, 
and why you should care.

Anjana suffers from a chronic case of curiosity, which led her from philosophy to English teaching to computational
linguistics to software development. These days she mostly codes & teaches from her home base in San Francisco, 
but sheâ€™ll always be a traveler at heart. Nerd out with her about functional programming & JavaScript, ask her about the
Recurse Center & Outreachy, and definitely invite her to your karaoke party!
