  We spend a lot of our time reading code for many different reasons, code that may have been written by yourself or someone else. So why not do our future selves and colleagues a favour and write code that at a glance will communicate what it's doing? And while doing that let’s leverage what TypeScript has to offer as well as some good functional programming practices. In the end, we want to spend less time trying to understand some “clever” code or uncover some hidden surprises and more time shipping value to our clients.

  I'm a Brazilian developer based in Ottawa, Canada. I have been building software for about twenty years, and my professional interests are mostly related to web development and different programming languages.
I sometimes speak my mind on my blog templecoding.com and I have produced a couple of online training courses for PluralSight.
Currently, I'm working at Shopify as a staff developer.
