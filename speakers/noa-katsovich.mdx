  As developers, when we start hearing about the feature we are going to develop - we begin to imagine the solution in our heads and try to solve the challenge as soon as we can.
But WAIT - is it the RIGHT solution?
We may develop quality code and still produce mediocre software. This is why we should look more into the context of software as a whole.
</p>
<p>
In this talk, we will explore some questions we should ask ourselves before starting to code.
After this talk, you will learn what is required to code more efficiently.
After a couple of times, it can become your superpower!
Trust me; I'm a product manager.
