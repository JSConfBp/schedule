  Covid-19 has changed the world. As someone working in IT I was one of the privileged who could work from home.
  It was not a choice, we had to work from home as a matter of survival. This situation has made an impact on
  our mental health. Things that were not important before, now they are critical. Others that were important before,
  they are not relevant anymore.

<p>
  Lots of people have shared with me how the pandemic was for them and their families. I will share with you some of
  those stories. After this talk you will know how they survived and improved during this pandemic and you will be
  able to apply several tips so you can thrive and improve on this new way of living as they did!
